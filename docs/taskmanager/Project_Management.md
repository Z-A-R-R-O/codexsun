# Software Project Management Blueprint

A concise framework for managing software projects from start to finish, using "Project" as the primary label. This blueprint is designed for easy explanation, with professional and clear phase names, and is extensible for other industries.

## 1. Project Initiation
Define the projectâ€™s purpose, goals, team, and stakeholder expectations.

## 2. Project Planning
Create a roadmap with tasks, timelines, resources, and risk strategies.

## 3. Project Development
Build the software, manage tasks, and ensure initial quality checks.

## 4. Project Testing
Validate the software through iterative testing (unit, integration, user acceptance).

## 5. Project Monitoring
Track progress, manage risks, and handle scope or requirement changes.

## 6. Project Delivery
Finalize, deploy the software, and provide initial post-deployment support.

## 7. Project Closure
Review outcomes, document lessons, and archive the project.
