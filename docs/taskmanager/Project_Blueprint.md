# Software Project Management Blueprint

A simple guide for starting software projects, using "Project" as the main term. This blueprint focuses on the Project Initiation phase, written in clear, easy-to-read English for everyone, with professional names, and ready to adapt for other industries. The table below outlines key activities, their purpose, steps, outputs, and the driving concept.

## 1. Project Initiation
Start the project by setting its purpose, goals, team, and customer needs.

| Activity | Purpose | Steps | Output | Concept |
|----------|---------|-------|--------|---------|
| Identify Customer | Find out who the customer is and what they need. | 1. Name the customer (e.g., a company or users). 2. Meet or ask questions to learn their needs (e.g., what the software should do). 3. Write down their budget and timeline limits. | Customer Needs List (a short note of what the customer wants). | Knowing the customer ensures the software solves their specific problems. |
| Set Project Goals | Decide what the project will achieve for the customer. | 1. Describe the software’s purpose (e.g., a website for online sales). 2. Make clear, realistic goals (e.g., finish in 4 months). 3. Match goals to customer and business needs. | Project Goals (a sentence like “Build an app to make booking easier”). | Clear goals keep the team focused on delivering value. |
| Create Customer Proposal | Show the customer a plan for what the project will do. | 1. Write what the customer wants and how the software will help. 2. Add a rough timeline and cost. 3. Share with the customer and get their okay. | Customer Proposal (a short plan of the project’s benefits). | A proposal builds trust and agreement with the customer. |
| Check If It’s Possible | Make sure the project can be done with the skills, money, and time available. | 1. Check technical needs (e.g., coding tools or skills). 2. Estimate costs and budget. 3. Spot problems (e.g., tight deadlines). | Possibility Check (a note on whether the project is doable). | Checking early avoids wasting time on impossible projects. |
| Build Project Team | Pick the right people to work on the project. | 1. List needed roles (e.g., coders, designers). 2. Choose team members with the right skills. 3. Plan how the team will talk to each other. | Team List (names, roles, and contact info). | A strong team with clear roles ensures the project runs smoothly. |
| Write Project Start Document | Create an official document to start the project. | 1. Write the project’s goals, scope, and customer plan. 2. Include a basic timeline and budget. 3. Get customer and team approval. | Project Start Document (an official paper to begin). | An official start aligns everyone and gives permission to move forward. |
