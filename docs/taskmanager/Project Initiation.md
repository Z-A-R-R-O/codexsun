# Software Project Management Blueprint

A simple guide for starting software projects, using "Project" as the main term. This blueprint focuses on the Project Initiation phase, written in clear, easy-to-read English for everyone, with professional names, and ready to adapt for other industries.

## 1. Project Initiation
Start the project by setting its purpose, goals, team, and customer needs.

### 1.1 Identify Customer
- **What It Means**: Find out who the customer is (e.g., a company, users, or internal team) and what they want.
- **Steps**:
  - List the customer or user group (e.g., a business needing an app).
  - Talk to them through meetings or questions to understand their needs (e.g., what the software should do).
  - Note their budget, timeline, or other limits.
- **Output**: Customer Needs List (a short document with what the customer wants).

### 1.2 Set Project Goals
- **What It Means**: Decide what the project will achieve, based on customer needs.
- **Steps**:
  - Describe the software’s purpose (e.g., build a website to sell products).
  - Make goals that are clear, measurable, and realistic (e.g., finish the app in 3 months).
  - Check that goals match what the customer and business want.
- **Output**: Project Goals (a sentence or two, like “Build an app to help users book appointments faster”).

### 1.3 Create Customer Proposal
- **What It Means**: Write a plan to show the customer what the project will do and why it’s valuable.
- **Steps**:
  - Summarize what the customer wants and how the software will help.
  - Include a rough timeline and cost estimate.
  - Share the plan with the customer and get their feedback or approval.
- **Output**: Customer Proposal (a simple document explaining the project and its benefits).

### 1.4 Check If It’s Possible
- **What It Means**: Make sure the project can be done with the available skills, money, and time.
- **Steps**:
  - Look at technical needs (e.g., what tools or coding skills are required).
  - Estimate costs and check if there’s enough budget.
  - Spot possible problems (e.g., tight deadlines or complex features).
- **Output**: Possibility Check (a short note on whether the project is doable).

### 1.5 Build Project Team
- **What It Means**: Pick the right people to work on the project.
- **Steps**:
  - List needed roles (e.g., coders, designers, project leader).
  - Choose team members based on their skills.
  - Set up how the team will talk (e.g., meetings, emails).
- **Output**: Team List (names, roles, and contact info for the team).

### 1.6 Write Project Start Document
- **What It Means**: Create an official document to start the project.
- **Steps**:
  - Write down the project’s goals, scope, and customer-approved plan.
  - Include a basic timeline and budget.
  - Get the customer and team to agree and sign off.
- **Output**: Project Start Document (an official paper to begin the project).

### Tools to Use
- **Customer Needs**: Simple forms, emails, or tools like Google Forms to collect customer input.
- **Proposal Writing**: Word, Google Docs, or note-taking apps for the customer proposal.
- **Possibility Check**: Basic checklists or team discussions to review risks and needs.
- **Team Setup**: Email, WhatsApp, or tools like Microsoft Teams for team communication.
